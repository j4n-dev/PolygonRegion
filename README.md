# PolygonRegion 🏗️

PolygonRegion is a Minecraft plugin developed for Spigot/PaperMC servers. 

This plugin allows players to define polygonal regions using WorldGuard and visually mark them in the game world. 
The regions are marked with red concrete item displays, and the corners are indicated with sea lantern blocks.
Players can add and remove points to modify the regions dynamically.

## Features ⭐

- **Polygonal Region Creation**: Define regions with polygonal shapes using WorldGuard and the RegionSTICK.
- **Dynamic Point Addition and Removal**: Add and remove points to modify the regions dynamically (even after you've created them!).
- **Visual Markers**: Use item displays and sea lanterns to visually indicate region boundaries and points.
- **Walls**: Create a visual boundary around regions with blocks/walls that fall from the sky and integrate smoothly into the terrain.
